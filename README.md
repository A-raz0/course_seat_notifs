## Course seat watcher

made just beacuse im too lazy to check the course search website every day in hopes the class i want/need opens up. so i built this to notify me when the class opens up a seat. can be ran through terminal but i decided to run through a render server as my laptop isnt open and running 24/7. 

### how to install and run
download all files and add to a folder 

in terminal :

cd path/to/folder_name

run : 

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

then run :

python3 monitor.py

and the tool will run a search of the courses every 2/3 mins and display the results in your terminal window.
